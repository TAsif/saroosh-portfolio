          <p>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. My name is Saroosh Ashraf and I am a third-year mechanical engineering student. As I progress through my years in university, I have taken a particular liking to mechanical design and infrastructure and gained a particular passionate talent in CAD modelling. I am extremely eager to learn and broaden my knowledge in the field, constantly participating in competitions and extra curricular activities. Currently, I am taking an extra curricular course offered by the MMRI, McMaster Manufacturing Research Institute. </p>
          <p>In my spare time, I enjoy taking on personal projects such as tinkering with 3D printing, as well as assembling Personal Computers for my friends and family. I enjoy playing the guitar as a hobby, and have a zest for travelling with my friends and family.</p>
          <p>I hope you enjoy viewing my personal projects and experiences that I have partaken in over the years!</p>

        <div class="btn-light" onclick="fullscreenText('gt')">
          <p>This project was particularly exciting because it introduced me to the workings of gear trains and 3D printing.</p>
          <p>Using Autodesk Inventor to design gears and housing brackets, me and my group were able to mount gears to 3D printed components and use a rotating crank to make two “fingers” rotate and touch.</p>

        <div class="btn-light" onclick="fullscreenText('pinch')">
          <p>To kick up the complexity, in my 2nd year I was tasked with designing a gripper component with CAD but this time the challenge was to communicate my design further rather than just simply 3D printing it.</p>
          <p>To communicate my design, I designed professional engineering schematics, complete with collapsed view, bill of materials, and exploded view to truly detail the construction of the gripper components.</p>

        <img class="pic" src="./img/pod.png" alt="Living Pod" onclick="fullscreen('pod.png')"/>
        <div class="btn-light" onclick="fullscreenText('pod')">
          <p>With the mastery of inventor, this project was designed to be particularly challenging because it combined an electrical aspect.</p>
          <p>Using CAD to design the housing for a motor and moving arms, me and my group were able to have the motors output their torque to the claw arms and create a robot that was not only able to move, but go over obstacles. This project felt particularly fulfilling to me because it allowed me to design something that actually accomplished a task of some sort.</p>

        <div class="btn-light" onclick="fullscreenText('sch')">
          <p>As I mentioned before, I enjoy taking part in engineering competitions to test my abilities and apply my knowledge to fun tasks.</p>
          <p>At the 2020 designathon held at McMaster, I was able to create a CAD model of a “living pod”, constrained with various quantities, such as max volume, and max material cost. The design was praised by judges as being very space efficient.</p>
